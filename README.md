# synteny-dysdera
Scripts to perform synteny between the spiders _D. silvatica_ and _D. catalonica_. 

**File transposition** folder contains sed-scripts or awk-scripts which change the format of the raw files into a more
desirable input file.

**Coordlines-into-fasta** and **Paflines-into-fasta** extract DNA sequences within a FASTA from a specified coordinate or paf-mapping
file. 

**ModEst-Genome-size-estimation** folder contains a few rough Rscripts to estimate the genome size prior to citometry
flux experiments. This can be a very powerful tool for organisms under-represented in genomics studies, the so called
non-model organisms, like *Chelicerates*; flux cytometry is expensive, thereby a precise estimation model can facilitate
obtaining such important data.
